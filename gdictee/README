2. Installation
--------------------------

 - Run gdictee.ins through latex

 - Move the resulting .sty file to a place where latex finds it.
   On a TDS compliant system this should be (substitute $TEXMF 
   with your local or home texmf directory):
   
     $TEXMF/tex/latex/gdictee/

 - If you want to produce your own documentation file (maybe 
   dvi instead of pdf) run gdictee.dtx through pdflatex.

 - Move the documentation (gdictee.pdf, if you haven't produced 
   your own file in a different format) in a TDS compliant 
   system to:

     $TEXMF/doc/latex/gdictee

 - If you like to, move the source files (.dtx and .ins) in a
   source directory of your system.
 
 - Update your filename database. How to achieve this depends 
   on your system. For teTeX `texhash' will work.

 - If you are using a non TDS compliant system take a look in 
   the documentation how to install new packages.
